# Notification at Top
Move Windows 11 / 10 notifications to the top of the screen.  
Update 1.1.0: Support For Microsoft Teams (Work, School, Personal) Notifications. Thanks [shankarnewton](https://github.com/shankarnewton) For The Suggestion.

Forked Update: Fixed notifications going out of bounds. Teams notification is not tested.
